THIS IS THE FILE TO CHECK THE CEPH
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI, which passively follows fixed instructions, agentic AI actively makes decisions, plans actions, and adapts to changing situations in pursuit of objectives. It combines reasoning, learning, and self-improvement to operate more like an independent agent rather than a simple tool. This allows agentic AI to handle complex, real-world tasks such as problem-solving, collaboration, and long-term planning with minimal human intervention.
